# Home-Sales
Challenge 22 

The purpose of this assignment is to develop hands-on experience with PySpark for big data analysis and optimization. By working with a real-world dataset of home sales, you will utilize SparkSQL to query, analyze, and manipulate data efficiently. This project focuses on critical concepts such as using temporary tables, caching for performance improvement, and partitioning datasets for optimized querying. Additionally, you will learn to compare query runtimes across various optimizations, demonstrating the practical impact of caching and partitioning. By completing this assignment, you will gain essential skills in big data processing, SQL query integration with PySpark, and performance tuning for scalable data operations.
